I am learning Spring boot again so that I can learn some new features of it even though I have made some projects already! I want to make my projects in optimized way because in previous projects I have faced some issues even though I have solved the issue but not in optimized way that means they just works but not I a way I wanted to. That's why LEARNING IS IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING

So, now I want to learn Sprint boot again and it's new features with some new technologies.

I will up updating what I have learned!
1. Today I have created REST API.
2. Got to know about new thing today and that is, instead of using application.properties one can also use application.yml by creating YAML file which is really easy and useful.
3. Today I got to know about SonarCloud which help us to enhancing our code quality.
4. Today I learned how we can schedule a task with Cron Jobs in Spring Boot
