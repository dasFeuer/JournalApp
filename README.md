# Spring-PracticeV2

I am learing Spring boot again so that I can learn some new features of it everthough I have made some projects already! I want to make my projects in optimized way because in previous projects I have faced some of issue eventhough I have solved the issue but not in optimized way that means they just works but not I a way I wanted to. That's why LEARING IS IMPROTANT FOR IMPROVING

So, now I want to learn Sprint boot again and it's new features with some new technologies.

I will up updating what I have learned!
